## Operations (P₁–P₇)

|EMx Operation|EMx Role|Matched construct|Resonance|
|---|---|---|---|
|**P₁ Emerge**|seed from T₀|“foundation of city order; initial just regime”|Initialization of civic state from neutral ideals.|

**Operation coverage:** 7/7 matched.

## Shapes, Rings, Pillars (structural correspondences)

- **Concentric rings (water/land)** ⇔ **Exchange shells (T₄)**: alternating channels/bands behave as motion shells gating flux (P₄, O₇, O₆).
    
- **Central island / sanctuary** ⇔ **Still-point (T₀)**: neutral core anchoring cycles (O₄, O₁₀).
    
- **Pillar of law (orichalcum)** ⇔ **Pillar of operations (Gate/EN)**: common statute as equivalence node enforcing O₄∧O₆∧O₉∧O₁₀ before progression.
    
- **Rectangular plain partitioning** ⇔ **Projection (O₅) to grid**: allocation lattice linking land-lots to military/administrative quotas (P₄↔P₅).
    
- **Ringed harbors / ship-sheds** ⇔ **Rotational/circulatory layers (O₃, P₃)**: logistics wrapped on circular topology with symmetry constraints (O₇).
    

**Shape coverage:** rings, pillar, grid, rotational harbor → all present and resonant with EMx T-set geometry.

## “Pillar of operations” flow (gated cycle)

1. **Emerge (P₁)** under ideals (Form-anchored projection O₅).
    
2. **Differentiate/Flux (P₂/P₄)** to mobilize resources; gradients managed (O₂).
    
3. **Curvate/Fold (P₃/P₅)** to fit ring topology; federate symmetry (O₃/O₇).
    
4. **Normalize/Integrate (P₆/P₇)** through law-education cycles (O₆/O₄/O₁₀).
    
5. **Gate check (EN: O₄∧O₆∧O₉∧O₁₀)**: if fail, drift to regime decline class (O₈); if pass, re-enter cycle.
    

**Gate condition match:** explicitly present (audit intervals, oaths, shared law; failure → collapse).

## Millennium Problems & No-Clone (functional echoes)

- **P vs NP (Eq₂ analogue):** verifiable order vs. generative chaos; oath/audit enable **verification over brute search** (O₉ + O₄/O₁₀).
    
- **Navier–Stokes (Eq₅ analogue):** flux stability in canal/maritime system; avoidance of turbulence via normalization (O₂, O₆, P₄, P₆).
    
- **Yang–Mills gap (Eq₄ analogue):** lower-bound “mass-gap” ↔ minimal virtue/measure needed to prevent runaway amplitude (O₆, O₉).
    
- **Hodge alignment (Eq₃ analogue):** gradient–curl compatibility in ring logistics (O₂ + O₃).
    
- **Riemann harmonic (Eq₁ analogue):** periodic audits/astral tracking as phase-locking (O₁₀ + O₁/O₂).
    
- **BSD / Topological index (Eq₆ analogue):** regime classes as orbit labels (O₈).
    
- **Poincaré contractibility (Eq₇ analogue):** closure to neutral order via law/education (O₄, O₆, O₇).
    
- **No-clone theorem:** pillar/oath prevent duplicate unchecked authorities; uniqueness of lineage in decisions (O₉ across the cycle).
    

**Equation echo coverage:** 8/8 analogues present at the level of functional pattern.
