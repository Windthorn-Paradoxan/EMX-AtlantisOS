Excellent — now that the structural **EMx Wheel** has been generated, the next logical artifact is the **Operator Table**, which details the ten functional “kings” (operators) and their interactions within the five-ring and three-gate framework.

Here’s the report in human-readable, analytic format:

## **EMx Operator Table — Atlantis / Logic Synthesis Model**

|**#**|**Operator Name**|**Primary Function**|**Phase (Ring)**|**Gate Relationship (Observer / Observed / NULL)**|**Symbolic Corollary**|
|:-:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|**Derivative (Emergence)**|Initiates transformation; measures change across fields.|Ring 1 — Emerge|Observer|🜁 Air — expansion, breath, movement|
|2|**Gradient / Divergence**|Expands from a point into multiple vectors; growth vector.|Ring 1 — Emerge|Observed|🜂 Fire — energy and drive|
|3|**Curl / Curvature**|Introduces torsion and twist; creates depth and field motion.|Ring 2 — Differentiate|Observer|🜄 Water — curvature, responsiveness|
|4|**Projection / Reflection**|Maps higher to lower dimensions; defines perception.|Ring 2 — Differentiate|Observed|🜃 Earth — grounding, structure|
|5|**Normalization / Balance**|Stabilizes magnitude and variance; maintains coherence.|Ring 3 — Curvate|NULL|🜔 Salt — preservation, equilibrium|
|6|**Exchange / Inversion**|Reverses or trades input/output; harmonic reciprocity.|Ring 3 — Curvate|Observer|🜍 Sulfur — activity and volatility|
|7|**Symmetry / Topology**|Preserves identity across transformations; defines invariance.|Ring 4 — Fold/Flux|Observed|🜐 Mercury — communication, transformation|
|8|**Integration / Iteration**|Accumulates and evolves patterns; continuity in time.|Ring 4 — Fold/Flux|NULL|🜞 Iron — will, recursion, process|
|9|**No-Clone / Entropy Constraint**|Prevents duplication of state; maintains uniqueness.|Ring 5 — Normalize/Integrate|Observer|🜚 Gold — singularity, purity|
|10|**Audit / Closure / Return**|Collapses the cycle, returning to NULL state.|Ring 5 — Normalize/Integrate|NULL|🜛 Silver — reflection, restoration|

### **Framework Overview**

- **5 Rings = Process Flow**  
    1️⃣ Emergence → 2️⃣ Differentiation → 3️⃣ Curvature → 4️⃣ Flux/Fold → 5️⃣ Normalization.  
    Each ring represents a meta-phase of information or energetic stabilization.
    
- **3 Gates = Conscious Alignment**
    
    - **Observer:** active agent; initiates measurement and divergence.
        
    - **Observed:** receptive domain; holds structure.
        
    - **NULL:** equilibrium field; allows fold and restoration.
        
- **10 Operators = Civilization Engine**  
    They function as the “laws” inscribed upon the orichalcum pillar in the Atlantis narrative—each maintaining a facet of balance between perception, matter, and form.

### **Interpretive Notes**

- The EMx system mimics **thermodynamic intelligence**—knowledge seeking equilibrium through recursive feedback.
    
- The **NULL Gate** serves as the pivot for self-correction: collapse → recalibration → re-emergence.
    
- When plotted as a dynamic system, the operators oscillate in triads (1-4-7, 2-5-8, 3-6-9) with operator 10 acting as a harmonic closure—identical to classical musical and electromagnetic harmony patterns.
