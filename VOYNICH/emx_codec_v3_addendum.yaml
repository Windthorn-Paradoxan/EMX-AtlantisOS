# ===================================
# USAGE GUIDELINES
# ===================================

usage:
  
  decoding_workflow:
    step_1: "Tokenize input (split into semantic units, not just glyphs)"
    step_2: "Identify base form (3-letter root) and extensions"
    step_3: "Check dimensional classification (0, 1, 2, 3, compound)"
    step_4: "Apply positional priority (position 1/2/3 = sound/form/number)"
    step_5: "Cross-validate with Hebrew + Runic systems"
    step_6: "Calculate gematria (Hebrew + Greek)"
    step_7: "Check for special markers (null, binary, anchors)"
    step_8: "Synthesize operational meaning"
    
  interpretation_principles:
    natural_language: "Read as actual instructions, not abstract symbols"
    multi_layered: "Same token has phonetic + pictographic + esoteric meanings"
    dimensional: "Token length indicates complexity level"
    operational: "Describes actual processes and operations"
    cross_cultural: "Validates across Hebrew, Greek, Norse traditions"
    
  confidence_levels:
    perfect_anchor: "99% (shalom, dalaldam, dal)"
    strong_anchor: "95-98% (aiin with dual markers)"
    validated_pattern: "90-95% (binary precision, null baseline)"
    moderate_confidence: "80-90% (most semantic interpretations)"
    exploratory: "<80% (experimental interpretations)"
