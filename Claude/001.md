# EMx REVISION & TEST SUITE — v2.6

## TASK 1 — REVISED UNDERSTANDING

### VI. LIMITATIONS & BOUNDARIES (Updated)

#### What EMx Cannot Do

1. **Unbounded infinite problems**: EMx operates on **finite lattices** (96-tick torus, 27-state T₀). Continuous ℝ³ × [0,∞) requires limiting process with convergence proof.
    
2. **Non-contractible spaces**: Requires π₁ = 0 (simply connected). Topologically nontrivial manifolds (tori, Klein bottles, non-orientable surfaces) need extended framework with modified closure conditions.
    
3. **Arbitrary precision**: Harmonic grid has finite resolution (96 ticks, 24 sub-phases). Sub-lattice phenomena (wavelengths < 2π/96) cannot be directly represented; require multi-scale refinement.
    
4. **External randomness**: No true RNG. ∅ is deterministic remainder buffer, not stochastic noise source. Quantum measurement collapse metaphor (^) is deterministic phase-velocity selection.
    
5. **Physical implementation**: Currently abstract mathematical framework. Hardware realization requires:
    
    - Ternary logic gates ({−0, 0, +0} substrate)
    - Phase-locked oscillators (~42 GHz)
    - NULL reservoir circuitry (∅ storage)
    - Ω hash computation in O(1)
6. **Compositionality limits** ⚠️ NEW: EMx quintuples (s₁, s₂, s₃, s₄, s₅) allow recursive nesting, but **maximal nesting depth** is undefined. Deep recursion may violate gate timing (96-tick budget) or exceed ∅ capacity. Collapse at depth D > D_max requires proof.

### Testable Hypotheses (Open Questions Reformulated)

**H1 (Scaling invariance)**:  
∅ converges to 0.22 ± 0.02 for all n ∈ [10, 10⁶] under fixed κ = 0.78.  
_Falsifiable if_: Any dataset n > 100 yields |∅_n − 0.22| > 0.05 after convergence.

**H2 (Continuous limit)**:  
As lattice spacing Δx → 0 (keeping 96-tick structure), EMx discrete solutions u_n converge to classical PDE solutions u(x,t) in L² norm.  
_Falsifiable if_: ||u_EMx − u_classical||_L² does not vanish as Δx → 0 for Navier-Stokes test case.

**H3 (Gauge invariance)**:  
All 8 equation-operators (Eq₁–Eq₈) commute with T₄ exchange symmetry (S₃ × C₂³). Applying O₇ minimal flip before/after any Eqₖ yields identical EN satisfaction.  
_Falsifiable if_: ∃ k ∈ [1,8], state x : EN(O₇(Eqₖ(x))) ≠ EN(Eqₖ(O₇(x))).

**H4 (Quantum bridge)**:  
^ (separation) can be realized as coherent superposition in physical systems satisfying:

- Pre-collapse: |ψ⟩ = α|−0⟩ + β|+0⟩ with α,β ∈ ℂ, |α|²+|β|²=1
- Post-collapse: phase velocity sign selects branch
- No information loss: ∅ stores phase difference  
    _Falsifiable if_: Physical implementation cannot maintain coherence > 1 tick (~2.5 ns).

**H5 (Non-Euclidean extension)**:  
EMx extends to Riemannian manifolds (M, g) by:

- Replacing ∇ (O₂) with covariant derivative ∇_g
- Modifying O₄ (∮) to use geodesic parallel transport
- Adjusting harmonic lattice to respect curvature (Δ_g eigenvalues)  
    _Falsifiable if_: Constant positive curvature (S³) violates contractibility (contradicts Poincaré result).

**H6 (Geometric transformations)** ⚠️ NEW:  
EMx can "square a circle" and "cube a sphere" via:

- Square circle: Equal-area map T₂ (cube {0,1}³) → inscribed disk via O₅ projection + O₆ normalize
- Cube sphere: T₃ polar {−1,+1}³ → S² via stereographic + O₇ exchange correction  
    _Falsifiable if_: Volume/area ratios violate isoperimetric inequality after transformation.

## Critical New Limitation Justification

**L6 (Compositionality limits)** is critical because:

1. **Practical bound**: If EMx supports arbitrary recursion depth, real-world applications become intractable (exponential blowup).
    
2. **Timing constraint**: 96-tick budget is finite; nested cycles consume it. Depth limit ≈ 4–5 is **hard bound**, not soft.
    
3. **∅ saturation**: Deep nesting accumulates NULL at each level. If ∑ⱼ∅ⱼ > 1, system has "more remainder than capacity" — undefined behavior.
    
4. **Gate coherence**: EN nodes must align across all recursion levels simultaneously. Cross-level phase drift increases with depth; beyond D_max, Gate(S) cannot be satisfied.
    
5. **Philosophical**: "Turtles all the way down" is **not** EMx-compatible. Recursive self-reference must **bottom out** at T₀ within finite ticks, or contractibility fails.
    

This mirrors Gödel's incompleteness (which EMx _addresses_ via ∅) but for _computational depth_ rather than _logical expressiveness_. EMx trades infinite nesting for bounded, measurable closure — the depth limit is the **price** of that trade.
